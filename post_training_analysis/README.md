# Post training analysis scripts

Here, scripts can be found which can be used after training or testing the CNNs.

## Sorting CNN models
The script ```CNN_model_sort.py``` sorts the models produced during training. Additionally, this script creates a csv file
containing the hyperparameters used to train the model. This csv file is also required to run the model on a test set.

## Generating heatmaps
This script generates probability and prediction heatmaps based on the predictions made by a CNN. This script requires
study summary csv file generated by the test-set CNN. Additionally, the image path to the test-set images should also be
provided. All input images should contain coordinate data in ```x=000, y=000, w=000, h=000``` format.

Here, three different heatmaps are created. The first heatmap is a graph plot without axis displaying a heatmap at the
location of the original coordinates of the input images. The second heatmap is a cropped graph, with axis displaying the
exact coordinates of the heatmap.

The third heatmap is a 1:1 reconstruction of the input images with a heatmap overlay for both the predictions and
the probabilities. This final heatmap is produced in TIFF format and, depending on the image size, a large amount of memory
might be used when generating this heatmap.
